### What is No Cloud?
No Cloud is an App for managing iCloud pictures.
Support synchronizing iCloud pictures to disk and batch deleting iCloud pictures.

### What can No Cloud do?
* Save moneyüí∞. If you don't care about money, it is recommended to purchase apple service.
* Back up iCloud pictures and videos to a selected directory.
* Move pictures to recently deleted folder.

### Advantages of No Cloud
* Safety. No Cloud's code is open source, you can view each line of code, or run and generate the app yourself.
* Simple. Only sync and delete functions are provided.

### Notes
1. Apple computers need to log in to the iCloud account and auth the permission to sync photos.
2. The default picture format is png, and the default video format is mov.
2. The default live pictures will be converted to png and mov formats.
2. Short video, live video, and slow motion will all be converted to mov.
3. Delete only resources that exist locally and the file is larger than a certain threshold (temporarily larger than 15kb).
4. Although the deletion is successfully changed immediately, there will be a delay, please be patient (Apple may need to slowly move to the recent deletion in the background).
5. If you have any suggestions for improvement, you can send an email to me at antwork@126.com.

### About the author
My name is Xu Qiang, and I am a senior iOS coder. I have been immersed in the field of coding for so long that I forgot my original intention to learn Apple's development. I was once full of passion at young age, looking forward to becoming a technology guy and turning my mindful ideas into reality. But i failed.

Recently, I had a deep talk with my leader and felt that I really lacked initiative and practice. I reflected on myself, and then I began to think about what my technology could be used to do. It happened that my iCloud kept reminding me to Upgrade. Although 21 RMB 200G a month is not much, it feels very luxurious. The most important thing is that iCloud has changed. It became a warehouse, full of old photos that might never be viewed.

With this as the starting point, I think it is possible to make a backup and clear iCloud app, so that even if there is only 5G free space for regular synchronization and cleaning, it is enough, and the photo backup to the local is relatively safer. 

Another issue to be solved is the issue of trust, so I thought about open source, so anyone can review the code if he/she is interested. 

It takes a lot of time to make an app. The main thing is that I never know what is the best, so after changing a few versions, I feel that the copy and paste function that comes with the system is simple enough and fits the overall design (The main thing is no need a designer üòë). 

If you think this app is making you life easy, please donate, thank you! </p>
